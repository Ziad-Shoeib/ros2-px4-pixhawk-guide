Before Installing ground control :

sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER
sudo apt-get remove modemmanager -y
sudo apt install gstreamer1.0-plugins-bad gstreamer1.0-libav gstreamer1.0-gl -y
sudo apt install libfuse2 -y
sudo apt install libxcb-xinerama0 libxkbcommon-x11-0 libxcb-cursor-dev -y



Frist step install Qground Control: https://docs.qgroundcontrol.com/master/en/qgc-user-guide/getting_started/download_and_install.html#ubuntu


2nd: Connecting the device::
Used Pixhawk V5+
# Checking USB connection

Installing ros2 pixhawk (Trial 1)

From: https://docs.px4.io/main/en/ros2/px4_ros2_interface_lib.html

cd $ros_workspace/src
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Auterion/px4-ros2-interface-lib
cd ..
colcon build
source install/setup.bash

But got this error:

CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:20 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findpx4_msgs.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "px4_msgs" with any

  Add the installation prefix of "px4_msgs" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "px4_msgs_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "px4_msgs" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.

Now I am trying from: https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/21128



git clone https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot.git

Removed both at the end because couldn't build.

I think you need to follow this steps:
https://github.com/PX4/px4_msgs
https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/21128

https://discuss.px4.io/t/px4-to-ros2-connection-does-not-work/31275/3

I tried this and worked :) -- removed log from build and install 
"I have encountered the same issue. First please try to check your current version of packaging

pip list | grep packaging

if the version of packaging is <22.0, please upgrade it to 22.0

pip install packaging==22.0

Then, remove log, build and install folders in the workspace and colcon build again. Hope this can help you to fix this issue too.

Now this problem 
"l-workstation@smlworkstation:~/ros2_ws$ source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash

run after "source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash"

but I think I need to run the gazebo example to see data

It worked :)

Now I need to read issues in the same form

but still this issue appear at the terminal "not found: "/home/sml-workstation/ros2_ws/install/libmavconn/share/libmavconn/local_setup.bash"
"

4/3/2025


See libproblem:
This is a common error in ROS2. The fix is very simple, to compile the workspace from scratch.

Use the following commands:

cd ~/ros2_ws
rm -rf ./build ./install ./log
colcon build
source install/setup.bash

After executing the above 4 commands, you should be able to launch your desired ROS2 program without any issue.

Let me know if this did not solve your issue.

"I am afraid to do this then px4-msg building problem will happen again"
I did and it worked but with some warnings after building

I will leave this issue for now and try to see taking the hardware readings

Finally, I was able to run it successfully on Ubuntu24.04 with ROS2 Jazzy + Gazebo Harmonic👊 Few small tweaks I had to make to make it compatible with Jazzy and harmonic. but mainly I was stuck with `drone not moving` issue with `pxh> WARN  [health_and_arming_checks] Preflight Fail: No connection to the ground control station` error which simply went away by installing QGroundControl.  Thanks for the tutorial.



___________________________________________________________________


6/3 Summary of the problems:

- px4_msgs built but after deleting the build install and building again but with some std warnings regarding ament path and colcon. and If I try to build again at one time the problem could reoccur again

- using px4 gazebo has a problem that connection to Qground control is not being established, tried fixing the path in launch files but still did not work. But the ros topics show and the listener launch file from px4_roscom reads the data of gyro and others from the drone simulation.
 
- I got the serial port agent by the hardware started but I didn't know how to start a client, as when I use a UDP agent a client is started automatically

- I tried editing the px4_roscom launch file of the listener that listens to drone topics in gazebo and changed the port to the serial port instead of the UDP port, but still the topics would not be published and running ros2 topics list does not show anything

- I ran an offboard example that should let me control the drone in gazebo with the teleop but it would not do it as no connection to ground station was established, but when I command a takeoff operation from Qground control (Connected to the UDP agent) the drone takes off in gazebo and when commanded to land it does the same. but controlling with teleop does not work

6/3 Next Steps: 

- Investigating why no connection can be established with Qground Control (as a warning) to see if it could be the problem.

- See how to start a hardware client beside the agent to get data from the hardware.

- I am thinking of reinstalling ros or at least make a new workspace if still the warnings with AMENT path and libview still happen

ROS 2 with PX4 running on a flight controller is almost the same as working with PX4 on the simulator. The only difference is that you need to start both the agent and the client, with settings appropriate for the communication channel.

For more information see https://docs.px4.io/main/en/middleware/uxrce_dds.html#starting-agent-and-client
https://docs.px4.io/main/en/middleware/uxrce_dds.html#starting-agent-and-client

I tried to run the listener node from px4-com but didn't see any published topics
and also Qground Control is not connecting to the V5+ while I am acessing the serial port

I tried editing the launch file of px4_roscom and changed cmd to: 'micro-ros-agent serial --dev /dev/ACM0 -b' OR ADDING THE BAUDRATE AFTER THE B BUT IT DID NOT WORK


When running gazebo from PX4 file I even get the same previous problem of no connection to Qground control

- Without starting a client, we tried changing the sensor_combined launch file to the serial agent started but could not listen to the topics
- We tried to start a client this way: uxrce_dds_client start -t udp -p 8888 -h 192.168.0.100 -n drone -- but we didn't find the uxrce_dds_client_start
- We also tried to see the commands that can be taken by: MicroXRCEAgent -h

-- What to do 10/4/2025 --

- from: https://docs.px4.io/main/en/middleware/uxrce_dds.html#architecture :
	- The agent itself has no dependency on client-side code and can be built and/or installed independent of PX4 or ROS.
	- Code that wants to subscribe/publish to PX4 does have a dependency on client-side code; it requires uORB message definitions that match those used to 		create the PX4 uXRCE-DDS client so that it can interpret the messages.
	- The PX4 uxrce_dds_client is generated at build time and included in PX4 firmare by default. The agent has no dependency on client code. It can be 	built standalone or in a ROS 2 workspace, or installed as a snap package on Ubuntu.
	- When PX4 is built, a code generator uses the uORB message definitions in the source tree (PX4-Autopilot/msg) to compile support for the subset of uORB topics in PX4-Autopilot/src/modules/uxrce_dds_client/dds_topics.yaml into uxrce_dds_client.
	- ROS 2 applications need to be built in a workspace that includes the same message definitions that were used to create the uXRCE-DDS client module in the PX4 Firmware. 
	- These can be included into a workspace by cloning the interface package PX4/px4_msgs into your ROS 2 workspace and switching to the appropriate branch. Note that all code generation associated with the messages is handled by ROS 2.
	
- from: https://docs.px4.io/main/en/companion_computer/pixhawk_companion.html#serial-port-setup :
	- To use ROS 2/uXRCE-DDS instead of MAVLink on TELEM2, disable MAVLink on the port and then enable the uXRCE-DDS client on TELEM2(see uXRCE-DDS > Starting the client).

- from: https://docs.px4.io/main/en/peripherals/serial_configuration.html : 
	- The configuration makes it easy to (for example):
	    - Run MAVLink on a different port, change the streamed messages, or switch a TELEM port to use ROS 2/XRCE-DDS.
	    - Change the baud rate on a port or set the UDP port
	    - Setup dual GPS.
	    - Enable sensors that run on a serial port, such as some distance sensors.	
	- uXRCE-DDS port: UXRCE_DDS_CFG,
	- Configuration Parameter Missing from QGroundControl: QGroundControl only displays the parameters for services/drivers that are present in firmware. If a parameter is missing, then you may need to add it in firmware.

________________________
1) I am not sure that if I need to write a custom code to publish the topics to the listener or what, but the documentation till now is not clear on the exact steps I need to do	
2) maybe investigate using Mavros with ros2
